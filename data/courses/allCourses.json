For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music itself.\n\nThis season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson.\n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis's lifelong learning initiatives.","tutor":"Jonathan Biss","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Music","studentsInterested":"2.2k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/beethoven-piano-sonatas","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-exploring-beethoven-s-piano-sonatas-730"},{"title":"Introduction to Graphic Illustration","about":"In today’s diverse consumer market, illustration exists through many forms of expression breaking with traditional roles of the illustrator.

Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.\n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.\n\nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.\n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n\nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.","tutor":"Loudon Stearns","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["digital music production","daw","digital audio workstation","usa","north america"],"subject":"Music","studentsInterested":"257","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/technology-of-music-production","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-the-technology-of-music-production-6351"},{"title":"Дизайн-методология: управление вдохновением (Design-methodology.

Как контролировать креативный процесс и при этом не препятствовать его свободному течению? Можно ли активировать креативную энергию? Есть ли алгоритм создания нового – ранее несуществовавшего? Ответы на них дает авторская методология семиотического дискурсивного моделирования дизайн-продукта (СДМ), которая представляет способ тонкой настройки сознания. Этот курс о том, как дизайнер должен думать и как исполнять свой замысел. В теоретическом блоке основное внимание уделено таким особенностям дизайнерского мышления, как симультанность, нелинейность, способность к «телепортациям» в будущее. В практическом – детально рассмотрены методологические процедуры и действия с указанием на типичные ошибки («ловушки»).

The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.\n\nBy taking this course, you will learn:\n\n• the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization;\n• how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work;\n• how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers;\n• how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and\n• how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.\n\nAll course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners. New scheduled sessions begin each month.\n\nFor more information about the DeVos Institute's work, visit www.DeVosInstitute.umd.edu.","tutor":"Michael M.

Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists. Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission.\n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing. We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools.

Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\n\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others.

Rather than assess the political efficacy of activities like mourning, listening, organizing, dancing, or partying, the lectures examine such cultural activities next to, and within, contemporary art practice.\n\nIncluded in the course are guest presentations by key artists, activists, and scholars, like: Rebecca Gomperts, Chido Govera, Gulf Labor, Hans Haacke, Sharon Hayes, Jolene Rickard, Gregory Sholette, Joshua Wong, and many more. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch and co-taught by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, the course challenges learners to treat the MOOC itself as a social and artistic form. This happens mostly through the practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback.\n\nWhile no prior art making or activist experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.\n\nFor other course offerings or language versions in this series, just search 'ART of the MOOC' inside the Coursera course catalogue.","tutor":"Nato Thompson and Pedro Lasch","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Art & Design","studentsInterested":"101","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/activism-social-movements","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-art-of-the-mooc-activism-and-social-movements-7195"},{"title":"Cultural and creative industries","about":"Main objective of this course is to trace the development of the Cultural and Creative Industries as an idea and as concept and to identify the key points of changes within it in relations with contemporary digital connected world. Another important task of this course is to provide the deep understanding of the difference between cultural and symbolic meaning products (such as films, recorded music, book and periodicals, online media content etc) and other kind of goods.\n\nThis course will help you to:\n- Identify main peculiarities of cultural and symbolic goods in their difference with other branches of economy in terms of production chain, risks, relationship between different stages of production.\n- Be able to analyze cultural products and symbolic goods from the organizational, economic, business model point of view.\n- Be able to invent new business models and analyze cultural products in terms of their productions risk.\n- Be able to analyze cultural policies and creative industries/clusters policies.\n\nMain prerequisite to this course is to be able to produce analytical texts in humanities. Normally the course addresses all students of master level interested in peculiarities of media and cultural economy and management. This course is strongly not recommended for those who:\n- Analyse any market or industry only in microeconomic terms (supply and demand, level of competitions etc). This course is not about market but about peculiarities of symbolic goods;\n- Try to interpret culture only in terms of marketing and management (i.e. culture is considered like a simple good to be sold to the consumer). This course considers it more broadly like a human agency to produce meanings of everyday life. That’s why cultural goods are different and can not be interpreted exclusively in terms of consuming and need more or less state support;\n- Try to interpret culture like pure “art” and consequently are absolutely not preoccupied by organizational aspect of its working.\n\nThis course uses a large number of concepts coming from different fields of science: political economy of communications, cultural studies, sociology etc. Some aspects of the course are commented by known scholars in this field such as David Hesmondhalgh (University of Leeds), Phillipe Bouquillion (University Paris 13 Nord), Bernard Miege (Grenoble Alpes University).","tutor":"Ilia Kiria","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["culture","creativity"],"subject":"Design & Creativity","studentsInterested":"36","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/cultural-creative-industries","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-cultural-and-creative-industries-10331"},{"title":"Cracking the Creativity Code: Discovering Ideas","about":"Skill at discovering new ideas, and delivering them, may be one of the most important practical job skills, in today’s and tomorrow’s job market.

Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting things together. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image’s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements of composition and “visual contrasts.” through style, juxtaposition, closure and figures of speech.\n\nUltimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.","tutor":"Gail Swanlund","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["image design","usa","north america"],"subject":"Design & Creativity","studentsInterested":"344","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-making","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-introduction-to-imagemaking-5455"},{"title":"Pro Tools Basics","about":"Producing music is an incredibly creative process, and knowing the tools of the trade is essential in order to transmit the musical ideas in your head into the DAW in a creative and uninhibited way.

You’ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio.\n\nThrough analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You’ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.\n\nThe goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.","tutor":"Prince Charles Alexander","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Music","studentsInterested":"182","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/vocal-production","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-the-art-of-vocal-production-7797"},{"title":"A tecnologia da produção musical","about":"Aprenda sobre o processo de produção musical (inclusive sobre gravação, edição e mixagem) e conheça as ferramentas disponíveis para criação de música contemporânea no computador.\n\nDevido à recente disponibilidade de softwares e hardwares de alta qualidade e baixo custo, agora as ferramentas de produção musical estão ao alcance de todos. Os álbuns deixaram de ser criados apenas em estúdios, agora também são criados em quartos. À primeira vista, isso é libertador. Qualquer pessoa pode criar um álbum por um custo bem baixo, basta comprar alguns equipamentos e um pacote de software. Mas, se você for mais a fundo, verá que não é tão fácil assim. É preciso conhecimento, dedicação e criatividade para produzir música.\n\nFornecer conhecimento é o propósito deste curso. Não importa o tipo de música que você está produzindo, há um grande conjunto de ferramentas que você precisará usar. Cada lição deste curso demonstrará um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produção musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produção musical de gravar, editar e mixar.\n\nVamos começar com algumas noções sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessários para gravar áudio em um computador, para que você compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produção musical.\n\nDepois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como edição. A edição nos permite dar a impressão de execuções perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na música contemporânea. A ferramenta de edição contemporânea é a estação de trabalho de áudio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de edição que são essenciais na produção de música contemporânea e que são fornecidas por todas as DAWs.\n\nApós a edição, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se você souber usá-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades básicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserções, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som também deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da música. Vamos analisar a compressão, a equalização e o retardo, além de examinar os muitos efeitos de áudio que são extensões desses dispositivos e como eles são usados em um contexto musical.\n\nNo fim das contas, o processo de produção musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade é um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, até que as ferramentas certas são usadas da maneira certa para compartilhá-la com o mundo. Se você tem uma ideia em mente, precisará passar por inúmeras etapas, cada uma com uma ferramenta importante, para chegar ao seu público. Traga a dedicação e criatividade para este curso, que ele fornecerá o conhecimento para fazer acontecer.","tutor":"Loudon Stearns","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["digital music production","music production","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Music","studentsInterested":"6","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/tecnologia-producao-musical","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-a-tecnologia-da-producao-musical-9642"},{"title":"Introducción a la producción de música","about":"Aprende sobre el proceso de producción de música -incluyendo la grabación, la edición y la mezcla- y sobre las herramientas disponibles para crear música contemporánea en tu computadora.\n\n\n\nEsta obra fue financiada con una donación del Banco Inter-Americano de Desarrollo con recursos del Fondo Coreano para la Reducción de la Pobreza.\n\nLas opiniones expresadas en esta obra son exclusivamente de los autores y no necesariamente reflejan el punto de vista del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, de su Directorio Ejecutivo ni de los países que representa.\n\nEl Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo no garantiza la veracidad de la data incorporada en esta obra.\n\n\n\nPuedes cambiar el idioma en Coursera de inglés al español utilizando la página de ajustes de tu cuenta.

With the help of great philosophers, you will rediscover the art of thinking.\n\nTo help leaders to be rigorous even without figures, great philosophers have lots of ideas. Managers are invited to rediscover the art of thinking. They should understand the role of mental models, realize the importance of cognitive bias, agree on clear definitions and efficient criteria etc.\n\nCreativity demands the ability to unshackle ourselves from conventional ways of thinking, to \"think outside the box\". But we need to go a step further. Once outside the box, we need to construct a new box or boxes (that is, new intellectual frameworks or models) to help us structure our thinking. Only once we have done so can we generate truly game-changing ideas.","tutor":"Luc de Brabandere","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["europe","france"],"subject":"Management & Leadership","studentsInterested":"4.6k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-philosophy","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-on-strategy-what-managers-can-learn-from-philosophy-part-1-1312"},{"title":"Project Management for Business Professionals","about":"This course provides an introduction to the concepts, techniques, and principles of project management.

You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context.\n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery.\n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen. International perspective on leadership, common traps & challenges, and opportunities of intercultural leadership.\nWeek 2 - Navigating Culture. Impact of cultural differences on organizations, decoding culture, culture classifications and stereotyping, developing intercultural intelligence.\nWeek 3 - Communication. Communication and its impact on leadership identity and relationships, managing communication to improve decision making, steps for developing your intercultural communication skills.\nWeek 4 - Motivation. Views on individual motivation, cultural differences in motivation, developing motivation and commitment in teams.\nWeek 5 - Networking. Patterns of interpersonal relationships in/across organizations, strategically developing social networks and social capital, norms for networking across cultures.\nWeek 6 - Conflict. Effective / defective conflict management approaches, dealing with ethical dilemmas.\n\nThanks to the participation of our alumni and of the Bocconi Alumni Association, participants will have practical insights on international leadership.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND\nAll are welcome!

It’ll be 1,000 minutes of content if you watch it all.\nWe’ll cover how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and marketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and more.\nYou can’t teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I suspect we can teach a surprising amount. We’ve tried to take some of the best speakers from the past 9 years of Y Combinator dinners and arrange them in a way that will hopefully make sense.\nWe’re doing this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for everyone. It will hopefully be valuable even for people who don’t want to start startups.\nTalks like these have really helped Y Combinator founders create their companies.

This curriculum investigates the practical, business side of design: getting organized and staying on-track through timeline projections, cost estimates and workflow charts in order to ensure success and profitability. Students will study the essential paperwork – estimates, memos, model releases, change orders and contact reports – and will look at contracts and copyright issues, and when to get legal and accounting assistance. Students will also learn the principles of research, and its important role in the work of a designer. From working in a small to mid-size design studio, to more independent roles, students will gain important skills in both understanding the context and needs of designers and the field broadly, and strategies for developing administrative processes that support these practices.\nThe program is intended for students who already have foundational training in Design, and who are looking to move into a design field in an administrative capacity, or for designers who are interested in gaining valuable management knowledge. On completion of the modules, students will understand the principles of how to make a business work cleanly and efficiently, how to manage yourself and your workflow, and how to ensure client relationships are productive and clear.","tutor":"Hope Forstenzer","provider":"Kadenze","language":"English","skills":["design","project management","canada","north america"],"subject":"Project Management","studentsInterested":"585","courseLink":"https://www.kadenze.com/courses/project-management-for-designers","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/kadenze-project-management-for-designers-3750"},{"title":"Digital Branding and Engagement","about":"Want to learn how to get people to engage with your brand, but not sure where to begin?\nDigital technology has rapidly evolved in the last decade, and so too has the way people communicate.

They can be found nearly everywhere in today’s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization’s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization’s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of “seeing” and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations.","tutor":"Daniel A.

Product is an all-encompassing term that includes physical goods, intangible services, and even ideas. There are three pillars to a successful product strategy: a clear understanding of (a) the target customers (WHO), (b) the specific elements of the product offering (WHAT) that satisfies consumer needs and dovetails with company capabilities, and (c) the tactical plans to reach end consumers (HOW). The value proposition has to be embedded in a coherent business model in order to create and capture value. But well-laid innovation plans can go awry without a consideration of the business ecosystem that includes competitors, collaborators, including suppliers, distributors, and retailers, or the contextual environment in which the company operates. In an interdependent world, fostering an integrated ecosystem is critically important for companies interested in maximizing the odds of innovation success.\n\nDrawing from many years of research, this course will offer a set of frameworks, tools, and concepts in order to develop innovative strategies in a holistic way so as to achieve leadership positions.","tutor":"Raj Echambadi","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Marketing","studentsInterested":"716","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/strategic-innovation-building-and-sustaining-innovative-organizations","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-strategic-innovation-building-and-sustaining-innovative-organizations-8321"},{"title":"Market and Competition in Pricing Strategy","about":"If you haven’t considered what the competition is charging, you may not be maximizing your revenue.

This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business’ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.\n\n“Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we’re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity.

Нагрузка прерывающего (interruption) маркетинга на потребителей постоянно растет. Множество компаний одновременно стремятся отвлечь потребителя, заинтересовать своим предложением - будь то рекламный баннер или видеоролик.\nПсихологически и инструментально пользователи отгораживаются от рекламы. Предпочитают самостоятельно искать необходимую информацию. Отвергают агрессивное воздействие.\nНавязчивый исходящий маркетинг уступает место входящему – доверительному, который фокусируется на создании контента, соответствующего интересам целевой аудитории и подает его в тот момент, когда потребитель заинтересован в этом. Так потребитель становится нативно информированным, а компании успешно генерируют лиды и конвертируют их в покупателей.\nСредства входящего маркетинга включают поисковый маркетинг (SEM) и маркетинг в социальных медиа (SMO).\n- SEM предоставляет контент по конкретному запросу пользователя, оптимизируя сайты под поисковые машины и улучшая их индексацию (SEO). По сути он использует стратегию блиц-крига. Ту же цель преследует контекстная реклама, представленная в этом курсе инструментом автоматизированной закупки (Programmatic).\n- SMO, напротив, основан на взращивании клиентской базы, завоевании доверия и повышении авторитета. Эффект от него не так быстр, но более долговечен.\nОсновным инструментом маркетинга отношений является CRM-система. Она понимается нами как подход к ведению бизнеса, в котором клиент ставится во главу угла деятельности компании.\n- В компаниях, где разработана CRM-стратегия, потребности потребителя обладают наивысшим приоритетом, а бизнес-процессы и корпоративная культура настроены на удовлетворение этих потребностей.\nИтак, входящий маркетинг создает поток потенциальных потребителей, а CRM-система занимается развитием отношений, конвертирует лиды в покупателей, а нейтральных покупателей превращает в лояльных клиентов. Обо всем этом мы расскажем вам в деталях на курсе.\nКурс подготовлен командой российских экспертов digital рынка, готовых поделиться своими знаниями и опытом. Мы старались сделать курс максимально практичным и полезным для вас, по принципу «Берись и делай!»\nОт лица всей команды приветствую вас на курсе!

These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems.\n\nThis course is the first in a sequence of three. It describes the two basic PGM representations: Bayesian Networks, which rely on a directed graph; and Markov networks, which use an undirected graph. The course discusses both the theoretical properties of these representations as well as their use in practice. The (highly recommended) honors track contains several hands-on assignments on how to represent some real-world problems.

Participants have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.\nThe course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.\n\nWhy Study Automata Theory?\n\nThis subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"\n\nThe concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.\n\nDuring the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.","tutor":"Jeffrey Ullman","provider":"Stanford OpenEdx","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Algorithms and Data Structures","studentsInterested":"587","courseLink":"https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycsautomata-automata-theory","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/stanford-openedx-automata-theory-376"},{"title":"Text Retrieval and Search Engines","about":"Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets.

First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.","tutor":"ChengXiang Zhai","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Algorithms and Data Structures","studentsInterested":"299","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-retrieval","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-text-retrieval-and-search-engines-2734"},{"title":"Machine Learning With Big Data","about":"Want to make sense of the volumes of data you have collected?

Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively. The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector. While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.","tutor":"Roger Peng","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Data Science","studentsInterested":"433","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-reproducible-research-1716"},{"title":"Mastering Data Analysis in Excel","about":"Important: The focus of this course is on math - specifically, data-analysis concepts and methods - not on Excel for its own sake.

The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.\n\nThe second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression.\n\nAll the data you need is provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you’ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in the future (module 1).\n\nThe course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions.

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.","tutor":"Wil van der Aalst","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["europe","data analysis","netherlands"],"subject":"Data Mining","studentsInterested":"2.2k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-process-mining-data-science-in-action-2445"},{"title":"Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce","about":"The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.\n\nTo investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki\n\nThe 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.","tutor":"Alexander S.

Samples can be more carefully selected based on a researcher’s judgment, but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors. Samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways, using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control. It is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed in this course. We will examine simple random sampling that can be used for sampling persons or records, cluster sampling that can be used to sample groups of persons or records or networks, stratification which can be applied to simple random and cluster samples, systematic selection, and stratified multistage samples.

Questo corso non è concepito per introdurre metodi e concetti che in qualche futuro potranno esservi utili in classe, ma per aiutarvi ad organizzare attività di coding in classe direttamente durante il MOOC. La maggior parte delle lezioni di questo MOOC sono appuntamenti in diretta streaming che potrete seguire in classe con gli alunni, mettendovi in gioco insieme a loro. Non occorre che abbiate dimestichezza con l’informatica, le attività proposte sono intuitive e divertenti e nei video farò del mio meglio per darvi spunti di riflessione ulteriori. Se non riuscirete ad organizzarvi per seguire le lezioni in diretta potrete sempre riusarle successivamente.","tutor":"Alessandro Bogliolo","provider":"EMMA","language":"Italian","skills":["teaching","europe","italy","programming","computational thinking"],"subject":"STEM","studentsInterested":"430","courseLink":"https://platform.europeanmoocs.eu/course_coding_in_their_classrooms_now","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/emma-coding-in-your-classroom-now-5652"},{"title":"Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests","about":"##\nAnyone thinking about taking an English language test, such as IELTS, will find this course particularly useful, but all English language learners will benefit from the tips and advice given in the course.\nThe course focuses on the IELTS test (International English Language Testing System).

With over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.\n\nThis course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application. More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a school list, and establishing an application plan. This course will not answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities. Ultimately, you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting you on the path to acceptance.\n\n* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to Penn. Furthermore, this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country. While other students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced Placement curriculum. The course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling – if you attend a school that offers university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to university. Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants. Undergraduate transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants will not.","tutor":"Erick Hyde","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Higher Education","studentsInterested":"305","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/study-in-usa","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-applying-to-u-s-universities-1620"},{"title":"American Education Reform: History, Policy, Practice","about":"Discover what shapes how we talk about schools today by exploring the history of U.S. education reform.

However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7. Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions.

The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics.

To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming—if done well—can be transformative for organizers and participants.\n\nCourse Level Objectives:\nUnderstand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities.\nDescribe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment.\nCompare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education.\nAnalyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution.\nRecommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.","tutor":"Dr. John C.

En prenant modèle sur la recherche, la culture scolaire renoue avec la rigueur de la démarche, le développement de l’esprit critique, la volonté d’explorer l’inconnu et d’innover, la créativité et la collaboration.\nLes enseignants engagent ainsi leurs élèves dans des projets coopératifs rigoureux où ils mobilisent de nombreuses compétences telles que : observer, questionner, décrire, formuler des hypothèses, capitaliser des savoirs, expérimenter, modéliser, échanger des informations, argumenter et valider des résultats. Le questionnement, l’erreur, l’essai, l’itération, la comparaison entre le modèle et la réalité, le travail collaboratif, l’ouverture de l’école au monde constituent autant de leviers pour les apprentissages.\nGrâce à la démarche d’Éducation par la recherche, les élèves s’initient dès le plus jeune âge aux outils et concepts de la recherche et de la production de savoirs. Ils mènent des projets dont l’aboutissement est un chef-d’oeuvre témoignant de leurs apprentissages, leurs compétences et l’avancée de leur réflexion.\nPourquoi le vivant à l’école ?\nLa biologie est une discipline qui étudie le vivant.","tutor":"Régis Forgione, Patrice Clair and Elaine Del Nery","provider":"France Université Numerique","language":"French","skills":["education","research"],"subject":"Education & Teaching","studentsInterested":"10","courseLink":"https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:USPC+37017+session01/about","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/france-universite-numerique-education-par-la-recherche-savanturiers-du-vivant-11189"},{"title":"Foundations of Teaching for Learning: Learners and Learning","about":"The Foundations of Teaching for Learning programme is designed for teachers and educators of all abilities and backgrounds; from those who are new to the classroom and looking for development, to experienced teachers ready to reboot their skills for modern education.

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly.

Most of the work happens behind a closed door.  Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three problems:\n1. They don't get much.  The principal or department head doesn't visit very often.  And there’s no built-in structure at their school for peer observation.\n2. The feedback isn't helpful or actionable.\nSometimes it's just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and while everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say \"you were wonderful\" don't make better teachers.  Or sometimes the feedback is critical in ways that don’t present clear next steps.  Sometimes it's vague or just plain wrong.  \n3. Some teachers can be defensive.  \n(Yes, we know – only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU.  You are different.  You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a \"let's fix this\" orientation. {Except sometimes maybe not.})\n***\nThis course is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own improvement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their teaching.","tutor":"Orin Gutlerner","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Teacher Development","studentsInterested":"123","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/course/teacherfeedback","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-on-the-hunt-for-feedback-self-directed-teacher-improvement-878"},{"title":"Children Acquiring Literacy Naturally","about":"In this short course you will explore the possibility that children might acquire written language in a way that is similar to how they acquire spoken language—without instruction.

Translating this research to practice, however, is often challenging for educational practitioners.  This course will offer practical application of research by linking it with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model (BTT)—a pedagogical framework for using research in the neuro- and cognitive sciences as well as research-based effective instruction to guide teachers in planning, implementing, and assessing a sound program of instruction for all learners. \nParticipants in the course will examine research from the brain sciences that can inform educational practice and be able to implement research findings using the instructional framework, The Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model. This model presents six stages, or “brain targets” of the teaching and learning process. The components include (1) establishing the emotional climate for learning, (2) creating the physical learning environment, (3) designing the learning experience, (4) teaching for the mastery of content, skills, and concepts, (5) teaching for the extension and application of knowledge, and (6) evaluating learning. A central theme of the model is the integration of the arts to foster retention of new information, conceptual development, and higher-order thinking and creative problem-solving.\nCourse objectives:\nDescribe themes in brain research that can inform educational practice consistent with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model.","tutor":"Mariale Hardiman","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"K12","studentsInterested":"449","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/course/braintargeted","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-the-brain-targeted-teaching-model-for-21st-century-schools-879"},{"title":"Engaging Students through Cooperative Learning","about":"Some of the most powerful and widely applicable research-proven instructional practices are those of cooperative learning, which are highly effective in engaging and motivating students.

In this course, we take a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like a microcontroller-based pacemaker, digital lock, and a traffic light controller. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this part 1 you will possess the knowledge to build your own traffic light controller from the ground up.\nThis is the fourth time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes over the previous offerings of the course. We did however break the large class into two smaller classes. There are eight labs in part 1 and six labs in part 2. Students can pick and choose a subset of labs to achieve certification.

Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. \nIn this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:\n3D geometry,\nprobabilistic state estimation,\nvisual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,\nlinear control.\nIn particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.\nThe course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks.

Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).\n\nFirst, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems.\n\nModel checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes\nthe functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.\nThe main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:\n\n- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .\n- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.\n- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties.","tutor":"Anne Remke","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["europe","belgium"],"subject":"Electrical Engineering","studentsInterested":"21","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-model-checking","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-quantitative-model-checking-7502"},{"title":"Cyber Security in Manufacturing","about":"The nature of digital manufacturing and design (DM&D), and its heavy reliance on creating a digital thread of product and process data and information, makes it a prime target for hackers and counterfeiters.

In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.\n\nSince then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.\n\nWe're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!","tutor":"Marcel Salathé, Ottar N.

Learn more about nutrition and how our diet profoundly impacts our current and future health. This course addresses the relationship between nutrition and human health, with a focus on health problems related to overnutrition.\nIn this course, Professor Sander Kersten from Wageningen University & Research will explain about the composition of the three macronutrients: carbohydrates, fat and protein. You will learn about their role in the body (how they are absorbed, stored and metabolized for energy) and their impact on our health. Moreover, this course will cover energy homeostasis and the regulation of body weight. You will learn about overweight and obesity and strategies to improve and combat these problems of overnutrition. Finally, the course will make you familiar with nutritional research and research methodologies.\n\nThis course is especially useful for health care professionals and people working in the food industry with a non-nutrition background.

All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.\nThe purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. \nBy the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.","tutor":"Clayton Cook","provider":"edX","language":"English","skills":["uwashingtonx"],"subject":"Nutrition & Wellness","studentsInterested":"3.4k","courseLink":"https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-resilient-person-science-stress-uwashingtonx-ecfs311x-0","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/edx-becoming-a-resilient-person-the-science-of-stress-management-1927"},{"title":"Clinical Terminology for International and U.S. Students","about":"Understanding the clinical terms and abbreviations commonly used during verbal or written communication in U.S. hospitals is challenging.

It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways? The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the course, learners should be able to:\n\n• Articulate key public health concepts related to global health;\n• Analyze the key issues in global health from a number of perspectives;\n• Discuss with confidence the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex, age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden can be addressed in cost-effective ways;\n• Assess key health disparities, especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people in low- and middle-income countries;\n• Outline the key actors and organizations in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical global health concerns;\n• Review key global health challenges that are likely to arise in the coming decades.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nValue Added of the Course\n\nThe course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive, by handling each topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health issues and what can be done to address them.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health\n\nFor almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see:\n\n- Required readings\n- Recommended readings\n- Recommended videos\n\nWe have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.\n\nFor each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nIn addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session.\n\nThe first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.\n\nThe second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nLearners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.\n\nWe have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered.

These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group of patients. This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination of the clinical effectiveness of the new drug in a wider variety of patient types, and more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed.

And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment.\n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure.\n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling.

Each module a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll begin by trying to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy.\n\nTopics you’ll learn about will include:\n\nEpistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;\n\nPhilosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;\n\nPhilosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;\n\nPolitical Philosophy, where we'll investigate whether we have an obligation to obey the law;\n\nMoral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;\n\nMetaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about free will and the nature of reality.\n\nThe development of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh's Eidyn research centre.\n\nTo accompany 'Introduction to Philosophy', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Introduction to Philosophy' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind.

While some recovered from the destruction, others did not. But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past. The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.\n\nWorking through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom: the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.","tutor":"Jacob Wright","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["bible","biblical studies","biblical history","christianity","usa","north america"],"subject":"Religion","studentsInterested":"8.3k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/bible-history","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-the-bible-s-prehistory-purpose-and-political-future-1406"},{"title":"Moralities of Everyday Life","about":"How can we explain kindness and cruelty?

We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course.\n\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic, way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices into “three vehicles”, three programs of theory and practice supporting the personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components: (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice; (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices, principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis; (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv) secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.","tutor":"Kurtis Schaeffer and David Germano","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Religion","studentsInterested":"669","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/buddhist-meditation","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle-1342"},{"title":"Philosophy, Science and Religion: Philosophy and Religion","about":"Philosophy, Science and Religion mark three of the most fundamental modes of thinking about the world and our place in it. Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to ‘pick sides’ and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we’ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.\n\nThis course, entitled ‘Philosophy and Religion’, is the second of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series, and in this course we will ask important questions about the age-old debate between science and religion, such as:\n\n• What kind of conflicts are there between religion and science?\n• Does current cognitive science of religion effectively explain away God?\n• If there is a God who has made us so that we can know him, why do some people not believe?\n• Is belief in science also a kind of fundamentalism?\n• What makes us good at getting, giving, or sharing, knowledge?

Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.\n***********************************************************************************************************\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n\n• Week 1: Introduction\nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week's reading to get ahead of the game.\nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero\nIn week 2, we begin our intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8\nVideo Lectures: 2.1-2.10\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 3: Adventures Out and Back\nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus, \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16\nVideo Lectures: 3.1-3.10\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 4: Identity and Signs\nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24\nVideo Lectures: 4.1-4.8\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 5: Gods and Humans\nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony. Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony, or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod, Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)*\nVideo Lectures: 5.1-5.9\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 6: Ritual and Religion\nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course)\nVideo Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 7: Justice\nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one? Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think. This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him. This family's cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings: Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides\nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae. Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage. Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles, Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae\nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade\nMoving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5\nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 10: Roman Myth and Ovid's Metamorphoses\nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound, witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid, Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13.\nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n***********************************************************************************************************\nREADINGS\nThere are no required texts for the course, however, Professor Struck will make reference to the following texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 1, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, trans.

In this course we will introduce you to the Middle Ages through a wide conception of magic. Students will have an approach to medieval culture, beliefs and practices from the perspective of History and History of Science. Popular magic, as well as learned magic (alchemy, geomancy and necromancy) will be addressed. Moreover, we will also deal with how eastern practices and texts influenced western culture. In July 2016, the course will contain a brand-new module devoted to astrology. Magic in the Middle Ages offers a captivating overview of medieval society and promotes reflection about certain stereotypes associated with this period.\n\nAt the end of the course, the students:\n\na) will have overcome the usual prejudices about the Middle Ages,\nb) will be able to analyze historical documentation from the Middle Ages and recognize the most common patterns of juridical documents regarding witchcraft, and\nc) will be capable of distinguishing between popular magic and the magic of the learned people; will have a notion of which spiritual practices were allowed in medieval Europe and which ones were related to the devil, and will be aware of the link between a cultural product and the society that produced it.\n\nThis course is taught in English, although subtitles in English, Catalan and Spanish will also be provided.\n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\n\nWeek 1.

Even Thomas Jefferson, who over time developed a deep loathing of Henry (some would say jealousy), had to admit that “it is not now easy to say what we should have done without Patrick Henry.” Edmund Randolph, a patriot leader in his own right, explained that “It was Patrick Henry … awakening the genius of his country, and binding a band of patriots together to hurl defiance at the tyranny of so formidable a nation as Great Britain.”\nYet, today, Patrick Henry is ill-remembered; most Americans might recall at best perhaps a snippet from a famous speech: “give me liberty, or give me death.” The reasons for our historic forgetfulness are several: after the Revolution, Henry chose to oppose ratification of the U.S. Constitution, believing that it created a distant and too-powerful government, and he refused proffered position in George Washington’s administration, diminishing his historic memory. Equally important, Henry died in 1799 shortly after a political campaign in which, at Washington’s behest, he opposed Jefferson’s and James Madison’s ill-advised radical states’ rights attack on the U.S. government, and Jefferson spent the next twenty-six years systematically attacking Henry’s legacy.\nPatrick Henry, who helped to ignite a revolution, deserves better. This course will explore how he over¬came challenges to reach the pinnacle of Virginia politics and unite Americans behind a challenge to Britain – the eighteenth century’s super-power, why he opposed the U.S. Constitu¬tion, and why he then came out of retirement to defend the people’s Constitution against the attacks of Jefferson and Madison.\nParticipants should evaluate Henry’s role in proclaiming a revolution and consider whether he had an equally important role in saving it. The course should also develop an improved appreciation for the complex political, economic, and religious forces that shaped the early republic. As a biographical course, it also demonstrates how personalities play an important role in even the most foundational national history.\n\n\nImage Attribution:\nThe background image for this webpage is Patrick Henry before the Virginia House of Burgesses by Peter F. Rothermel (1851) with special thanks to the owner, the Patrick Henry Memorial Foundation. The painting of Patrick Henry's 1765 \"Caesar had his Brutus\" speech (discussed in the second lecture) is entirely romanticized -- neither Henry nor the House of Burgesses looked at all like this -- but it does show that hagiography of Henry, almost god-like veneration, began shortly after this death.","tutor":"John Ragosta","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"History","studentsInterested":"497","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/henry","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-patrick-henry-forgotten-founder-8669"},{"title":"English Composition I","about":"You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field.

Marcia Hepps, Peter Schwarz and Jim Schlatter of the Unbinding Prometheus team are producing an abridged  live concert performance at Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania on September 18th, 2014.  This course will make use of the performance video to consider and discuss aspects of the performance of Shelley's work.  Additionally, Unbinding Prometheus is also producing a complete, unabridged studio recording of the entire poem. Our MOOC students will thus be able to utilise a complete, multi-part audio-video-text alignment to assist their studies.  \nOur video-recorded lessons are various. About half consist of a mix of short lectures, interviews and conversations with literary critics and scholars, poets, as well as philosophers, actors, directors, historians, and groups of students. \nAnother half are collaborative close seminar readings by the Unbinding Prometheus seminar group, led by Eric Alan Weinstein.  These offer sample models of readers' engagement with, and interpretations of, this unique and  powerful poem. \nFinally, twice a week there will be opportunities to participate in live, global, online seminars where you get to join us, and become part of our course's shared video content.

Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\nThis course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThree common themes will characterise the course: \n\nWe privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. \n\nWe seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. \n\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. \n\nUltimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.","tutor":"Ebrahim Afsah","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["denmark","north america"],"subject":"History","studentsInterested":"3.2k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/muslim-world","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-constitutional-struggles-in-the-muslim-world-663"},{"title":"Creative Writing: The Craft of Setting and Description","about":"In this course aspiring writers will be introduced to the techniques that masters of fiction use to ground a story in a concrete world.

It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.\n\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all).\n\nWe'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.","tutor":"Douglas Kearney","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["poetry","usa","north america"],"subject":"Literature","studentsInterested":"799","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/poetry-workshop","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-sharpened-visions-a-poetry-workshop-4185"},{"title":"Creative Writing: The Craft of Style","about":"Your style is as unique and distinctive as your face, your voice, except that you can choose it, you can can work on it, enhance it.

La démarche proposée se veut critique, il ne s’agit ni de canoniser ni de condamner Calvin, mais de comprendre sa pensée avec toute la distance requise et d’en analyser les enjeux.\n\nAu cours de la première semaine, nous explorerons les principales étapes de la vie de Calvin. Les semaines 2 et 3 seront consacrées à l’étude de sa pensée théologique et de son éthique. Enfin, lors des semaines 4 et 5, nous nous interrogerons sur la diffusion du calvinisme dans le monde et la pertinence actuelle de la pensée de Calvin.\n\n--\nThis course is an introduction to the life and thought of the reformer John Calvin (1509-1564) and to his influence on the modern and contemporary world. The approach we develop is critical: we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.\n\nDuring five weeks, we will explore together the life and work of the Reformer. During the first week, we will study the main aspects of Calvin’s life. Weeks 2 and 3 will focus on his theology and his ethics. During the last two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), we will ponder how Calvinism became a worldwide phenomenon and ask ourselves what kind of relevance Calvin’s thought may still have today.","tutor":"Christophe Chalamet, Michel Grandjean, François Dermange and Sarah Nicolet","provider":"Coursera","language":"French","skills":["europe","switzerland"],"subject":"Philosophy","studentsInterested":"49","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/calvin","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-calvin-histoire-et-reception-d-une-reforme-659"},{"title":"The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem","about":"The destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the Babylonian Exile were a great catastrophe in the history of the Jewish Nation.\nWhat really happened during that dark, fateful age, and how did new opportunities arise from the ashes?","tutor":"Oded Lipschits and Ido Koch","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["asia","israel"],"subject":"History","studentsInterested":"308","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/jerusalem","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-the-fall-and-rise-of-jerusalem-974"},{"title":"Writing in the Sciences","about":"This course teaches scientists to become more effective writers, using practical examples and exercises.

But do you know when to believe what others say? For example, how quick should we be to accept something that someone else tells us is true, and what should we be looking out for when assessing a person's trustworthiness? Meanwhile, what should we do when we encounter disagreements with people who seem to be our equals? How and when should we adjust our beliefs, and how does the appropriate response vary depending on the evidence? These challenges may be especially important in the arena of religious disagreements. How should we weigh the evidence for and against various theistic and atheistic stances?\n\nExperts in psychology, philosophy, theology and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it’s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.\n\nIn this course. we will examine the following major questions about applied issues surrounding intellectual humility:\n\n• Should you believe what people say?\n• How should we handle disagreement?\n• What is the role of evidence in resolving religious disagreements?\n\nAll lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life.\n\nThis course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility. Before, we considered how to define and measure intellectual humility, what intellectual virtue is, whether we are born or can become humble, and what cognition and emotions can tell us about intellectual humility.

For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.\n\nThe first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.\n\nThe third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present.

We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished. The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.\n\nWe shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas’ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin’s Geneva to Elizabeth’s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\n\nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God’s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story.

You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course, you are able to:\n\n1. Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy)\n2. Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades\n3. Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context\n4. Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization\n\n\nRecommended Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy is this course important for me?\n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course?\n\nWe build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions.

As civilized human beings, we fail to understand how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem – the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. This course is the second of the two courses and covers three themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: The Final Solution\nWe’ll look at the cultural and mental processes that paved the way to the comprehensive and systematic mass murder of Jews in Europe – that is, the Final Solution. As part of this hard lesson we will discuss the various characteristics of the murder sites and death camps, and reveal selected aspects of the horror that occurred in them.\n\nWeek 2: Jewish and Non-Jewish Responses to the Holocaust\nWe will try to explore questions regarding knowledge about the application of the Final Solution, as well as a variety of responses and annihilation of victims, local populations and perpetrators.\n\nWeek 3: The End of the War\nWe will dedicate this lesson to the events that occurred in the last years of the Holocaust, as well as questions of memory, commemoration and future research.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you register for \"The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World\" as well.

We recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations, business cases and battles in an effort to truly understand constructing a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations. But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from the experience.\n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to adopt your position and to take action on your advice.\n\nWhat advice can I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with others in a similar position.\n\nOn the other hand, you might be open for suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example, you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth. During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n• Frame a starting position for your own research\n• Use search engines to locate materials required for your advice\n• Explore ‘academic’ data-bases\n• Annotate your sources correctly\n• Target your research for statistical data\n• Choose a visualisation for your statistical data\n• Construct an argument in a logical manner\n• Build up the logic in each paragraph\n• Conduct a SWOT analysis\n• Conduct a Risk Analysis\n• Present the materials in a position paper\n• Convert the position paper to a policy advice\n• Recognise the policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly\n• Write a powerful and effective PowerPoint presentation\n• Place your project in the ‘real world’ context of the policy-cycle\n• And ... Discover a great, great deal about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more than an one hour for each module.\nThe project-time depends on the degree of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections, then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career.

The course will focus on some of the realizations from the study of dynamical systems that are of particular relevance to complex systems:\n1.  Dynamical systems undergo bifurcations, where a small change in a system parameter such as the temperature or the harvest rate in a fishery leads to a large and qualitative change in the system's\nbehavior.\n2.  Deterministic dynamical systems can behave randomly.  This property, known as sensitive dependence or the butterfly effect, places strong limits on our ability to predict some phenomena.\n3.  Disordered behavior can be stable.  Non-periodic systems with the butterfly effect can have stable average properties.  So the average or statistical properties of a system can be predictable, even if its details are not.\n4.  Complex behavior can arise from simple rules.  Simple dynamical systems do not necessarily lead to simple results.  In particular, we will see that simple rules can produce patterns and structures of surprising complexity.","tutor":"David Feldman","provider":"Complexity Explorer","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Calculus","studentsInterested":"10.5k","courseLink":"https://www.http://chaos.complexityexplorer.org/","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/complexity-explorer-introduction-to-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-1182"},{"title":"Introduction to Mathematical Thinking","about":"Learn how to think the way mathematicians do – a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.\n\nMathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world.

We then dig deeper into the dynamics of maps—discrete-time dynamical systems—encountering and unpacking the notions of state space, trajectories, attractors and basins of attraction, stability and instability, bifurcations, and the Feigenbaum number. We then move to the study of flows, where we revisit many of the same notions in the context of continuous-time dynamical systems. Since chaotic systems cannot, by definition, be solved in closed form, we spend several weeks thinking about how to solve them numerically and what challenges arise in that process. We finish by learning about techniques and tools for applying all of this theory to real-world data.","tutor":"Liz Bradley","provider":"Complexity Explorer","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Calculus","studentsInterested":"1.3k","courseLink":"https://www.http://nonlinear.complexityexplorer.org/","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/complexity-explorer-nonlinear-dynamics-mathematical-and-computational-approaches-1195"},{"title":"Estadística Aplicada a los Negocios","about":"Este curso proporciona una introducción al análisis de datos en base a las principales herramientas estadísticas, enfocándose en la estadística descriptiva y la estadística inferencial.\nSe estudian los diferentes tipos de gráficos estadísticos utilizados para describir el comportamiento de los datos.

You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned?

Regression is the engine behind a multitude of data analytics applications used for many forms of forecasting and prediction.\nThis is the fourth course in the specialization, \"Business Statistics and Analysis\". The course introduces you to the very important tool known as Linear Regression. You will learn to apply various procedures such as dummy variable regressions, transforming variables, and interaction effects. All these are introduced and explained using easy to understand examples in Microsoft Excel.\nThe focus of the course is on understanding and application, rather than detailed mathematical derivations.\nNote: This course uses the ‘Data Analysis’ tool box which is standard with the Windows version of Microsoft Excel. It is also standard with the 2016 or later Mac version of Excel. However, it is not standard with earlier versions of Excel for Mac.\n\n\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Regression Analysis: An Introduction\nIn this module you will get introduced to the Linear Regression Model. We will build a regression model and estimate it using Excel. We will use the estimated model to infer relationships between various variables and use the model to make predictions. The module also introduces the notion of errors, residuals and R-square in a regression model.\n\nTopics covered include:\n• Introducing the Linear Regression\n• Building a Regression Model and estimating it using Excel\n• Making inferences using the estimated model\n• Using the Regression model to make predictions\n• Errors, Residuals and R-square\n\n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Regression Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Goodness of Fit\nThis module presents different hypothesis tests you could do using the Regression output. These tests are an important part of inference and the module introduces them using Excel based examples. The p-values are introduced along with goodness of fit measures R-square and the adjusted R-square. Towards the end of module we introduce the ‘Dummy variable regression’ which is used to incorporate categorical variables in a regression.\n\nTopics covered include:\n• Hypothesis testing in a Linear Regression\n• ‘Goodness of Fit’ measures (R-square, adjusted R-square)\n• Dummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n\n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Regression Analysis: Dummy Variables, Multicollinearity\nThis module continues with the application of Dummy variable Regression. You get to understand the interpretation of Regression output in the presence of categorical variables. Examples are worked out to re-inforce various concepts introduced.

Он поможет создать базу для успешного освоения дисциплин, в которых необходимы знания основ дифференциального и интегрального исчисления. Без этих навыков невозможна успешная деятельность инженеров и специалистов любого профиля.\nФизические явления и законы так или иначе описываются математическими формулами. Важнейшие открытия и изобретения в мире не обходятся без математики. Для решения широкого круга задач необходимо использовать математический аппарат, связанный с дифференциальным и интегральным исчислением функций одной вещественной переменной.\nОсвоив этот курс, вы сможете применять свои знания не только в физике для расчета, например, траекторий движения космических ракет и спутников, для прогнозирования работы ядерных реакторов, но и в геологии, биологии, экономике и др. для прогнозирования различных динамических процессов.\nКурс включает в себя тесты и набор заданий, формирующий основные навыки, которыми несколько облегчат изучение общей физики, так как позволят сконцентрироваться на физической сути явлений.\nОсвоившие курс учащиеся смогут решать следующие физические задачи:\n• находить кинематические характеристики движения тел;\n• исследовать характер движения тел при заданном законе движения;\n• определять качественное поведение рассматриваемых физических величин в предельных случаях;\n• определять действующие на тело силы при заданном законе движения и т. п.\nТакже прошедшие обучение смогут:\n• строить уравнение касательной к графику функции в заданной точке;\n• находить среднее значение функции на заданном отрезке;\n• находить площади фигур, ограниченных заданными кривыми.\nДля успешного освоения курса слушателю желательно знать основы математики и физики в объеме школьной программы.","tutor":"Романов Александр Иванович","provider":"Coursera","language":"Russian","skills":["russia","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Calculus","studentsInterested":"2","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/proizvodnaya-i-integral-v-fizike","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera---------7806"},{"title":"Математика для всех","about":"Курс состоит из нескольких жизненных сюжетов, каждый из которых разбирается \"по косточкам\" и, как выясняется, содержит внутри себя нетривиальное математическое ядро.

Real-world data often require more sophisticated models to reach realistic conclusions. This course aims to expand our “Bayesian toolbox” with more general models, and computational techniques to fit them. In particular, we will introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which allow sampling from posterior distributions that have no analytical solution. We will use the open-source, freely available software R (some experience is assumed, e.g., completing the previous course in R) and JAGS (no experience required). We will learn how to construct, fit, assess, and compare Bayesian statistical models to answer scientific questions involving continuous, binary, and count data. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development, explanations of the statistical modeling process, and a few basic modeling techniques commonly used by statisticians. Computer demonstrations provide concrete, practical walkthroughs.

We will study Ramsey Theory which proves that in a large system, complete disorder is impossible!\n\nBy the end of the course, we will implement an algorithm which finds an optimal assignment of students to schools. This algorithm, developed by David Gale and Lloyd S. Shapley, was later recognized by the conferral of Nobel Prize in Economics.\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity.

Towards the end of the course, you'll write code blocks and encounter Jupyter notebooks in Python, but don't worry, these will be quite short, focussed on the concepts, and will guide you through if you’ve not coded before.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have an intuitive understanding of vectors and matrices that will help you bridge the gap into linear algebra problems, and how to apply these concepts to machine learning.","tutor":"David Dye, Samuel J.

Learners will have the opportunity to apply these methods to example data in R (free statistical software environment).\n\nAt the end of the course, learners should be able to:\n1. Define causal effects using potential outcomes\n2. Describe the difference between association and causation\n3. Express assumptions with causal graphs\n4. Implement several types of causal inference methods (e.g. matching, instrumental variables, inverse probability of treatment weighting)\n5. Identify which causal assumptions are necessary for each type of statistical method\n\nSo join us.... and discover for yourself why modern statistical methods for estimating causal effects are indispensable in so many fields of study!","tutor":"Jason A.

Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers’ properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said “The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics”. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity.

They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

Evariste Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe ainsi à ce polynôme un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l'on appelle maintenant son groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première fois, dans ce cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en mathématiques. Son étude lui permet d'expliquer pourquoi les racines d'une équation prise au hasard ne s'expriment en général pas par des formules algébriques faisant intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un résultat démontré auparavant par Abel. Plus généralement, l'étude du groupe de Galois du polynôme permet de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe. C'est ce que l'on appelle la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d'une part la théorie des corps, d'autre part la théorie des groupes.Ce cours expliquera cette théorie en n'utilisant que des résultats de base d'algèbre linéaire. Nous étudierons d'un côté la théorie des corps, c'est-à-dire la façon dont les corps s'emboîtent les uns dans les autres, en introduisant la notion de nombre algébrique (essentiellement les racines de polynômes). D'un autre côté, nous introduirons les éléments nécessaires à l'étude des groupes de permutations. Cela nous permettra d'expliquer la théorie de Galois, non seulement dans son cadre d'origine, c'est-à-dire quand les coefficients du polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans un cadre plus général, par exemple lorsqu'on réduit ces coefficients modulo un nombre premier p.\n\nLe cours culminera avec une comparaison des groupes de Galois dans ces deux situations (« entière » et après réduction modulo p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul puissant de ces groupes.\n\nCe cours est l'occasion d'aborder des notions d'algèbre variées, essentielles dans de nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très rapidement aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables.

В том же году он доказал замечательную формулу, которая связывает число вершин, граней и ребер многогранника в трехмерном пространстве. Формула таинственным образом верна и для графов, которые называются \"планарными\". Эти два результата заложили основу теории графов и неплохо иллюстрируют направление ее развития по сей день.\n\nГраф как математический объект оказался полезным во многих теоретических и практических задачах. Наверное, дело в том, что сложность его структуры хорошо отвечает возможностям нашего мозга: это структура наглядная и понятно устроенная, но, с другой стороны, достаточно богатая, чтобы улавливать многие нетривиальные явления. Если говорить о приложениях, то, конечно, сразу же на ум приходят большие сети: Интернет, карта дорог, покрытие мобильной связи и т.п. В основах поисковых машин, таких, как Yandex и Google, лежат алгоритмы на графах. Помимо computer science, графы активно используются в биоинформатике, химии, социологии.\n\nЭтот курс служит введением в современную теорию графов. Мы, конечно, обсудим классические задачи, но и поговорим про более недавние результаты и тенденции, например, про экстремальную теорию графов.\n\nМатериал изложен с самых основ и на доступном языке.

Многие кёнигсбержцы пытались решить эту задачу как теоретически, так и практически во время прогулок. Доказать или опровергнуть возможность существования такого маршрута никто не мог до 1736 года, когда выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер не написал письмо своему другу с решением. Ответ был «нельзя». Так и родилась теория графов. Но что будет, если процесс, который описывает граф – случаен?\n\nТеория случайных графов находится на стыке теории графов и теории вероятностей. Наука появилась в середине ХХ века, и она сразу же привлекла огромное внимание как со стороны чистых математиков, так и со стороны прикладников. В курсе мы изучим как основы теории случайных графов, так и настоящие ее жемчужины.\n\nМы научимся воспринимать многие сложные системы как \"случайные графы\". Среди них – интернет, социальные сети (Фейсбука, Вконтакте), биологические, межбанковские сети.\n\nПрослушав этот курс, вы проникнетесь чрезвычайно красивой математической теорией и научитесь решать комбинаторные и алгоритмические задачи на случайных графах. Все эти знания позволят нам затем перейти к курсу веб-графов, в котором мы расскажем о самых современных приложениях вероятностно-графовых моделей и конструкций.\n\nДля освоения материала будет достаточно математики школьного уровня, базовых знаний комбинаторики и теории вероятностей.","tutor":"Андрей Райгородский","provider":"Coursera","language":"Russian","skills":["russia","graph theory","probability theory","random graph theory"],"subject":"Statistics & Probability","studentsInterested":"14","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/sluchajnye-graphy","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera---4484"},{"title":"Calculus: Single Variable Part 3 - Integration","about":"Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat.

В курсе мы познакомим слушателей с наиболее важными областями и инструментами современной комбинаторики, причем многие темы курса по сути уникальны: здесь не только классические комбинаторные величины и тождества, но также и общая теория обращения Мебиуса, и диаграммы Юнга, и рекурсия, и производящие функции. Это позволит нам в дальнейших курсах выйти на реальные приложения в анализе таких сложных сетей, как Интернет, социальные, биологические сети, сети межбанковских взаимодействий и др.\n\nДля участия в курсе слушателю необходимо иметь базовые представления о теории множеств и началах анализа. Все остальные понятия будут введены в ходе курса.\n\nКурс состоит из 7 недель лекций и 1 недели экзамена. Каждую неделю слушатель выполняет задания, составляющие 10% от всего курса (5% тест и 5% задачи с ответом).

В нашем курсе мы познакомим слушателей прежде всего с самыми основами предмета. И сделаем мы это в уникальном формате - иллюстрируя вероятностные объекты и методы на примерах решения с их помощью комбинаторных задач. Суть в том, что, конечно, в базовой вероятности много комбинаторики, и это все знают; мы же расскажем не только об этом, но и о том, как, наоборот, вероятностные методы позволяют работать с комбинаторными задачами. Это позволит нам впоследствии выйти на приложения вероятности в теории графов, случайных графов и, наконец, веб-графов и прочих сложных сетей. Также в рамках курса мы оторвемся от чисто комбинаторных интерпретаций и обсудим более общие вероятностные модели. Но интуиция все равно сохранится, и в этой комбинаторной подоплеке уникальность курса.\n\nКурс построен так, что будет по плечу даже тем, кто изучал математику последний раз только в школе. Тем не менее, так как для понимания курса необходимы знания основ комбинаторики, мы рекомендуем пройти наш курс по комбинаторике прежде чем прослушивать данный курс.\n\nВнутри курса также все просто – каждую неделю вас ждут видеолекции и проверочные задания, которые нужно выполнять в срок.

On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement.\n\nI hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide. In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation:\n\n(1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy\n\n(2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success\n\n(3) Close: Create a Contract\n\n(4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game\n\nTo successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to do the following:\n\n(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.” Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!\n\n(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course. These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/\n\n(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.\n\nCourse Certificate\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate.

It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration. This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others.\n\nThe principal learning activity in the course is a series of \"differents\" where you are challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Beginning with a prompt, e.g. \"eat something different\", you will begin to recognize your own = limits and to overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by it's nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society. In this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. At the same time, these exercises are constrained by concerns of safety, legality, and economics, which are addressed in their creative process.","tutor":"Brad Hokanson and Marit McCluske","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Self Improvement","studentsInterested":"1.0k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/creative-problem-solving","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-creative-problem-solving-1636"},{"title":"High-Impact Business Writing","about":"Effective writing is a powerful tool in the business environment.

Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted in evidence from psychology and neuroscience. Mindfulness has become the basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness. For millions around the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.\n\nBut, what actually is mindfulness? Is it really good for you? Can anyone learn it? How can you recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would it smell like sandalwood? What does it feel like to be mindful? Are you mindful already, and how would you know?\n\nEvolving from the popular Honours Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed ‘meditation labs,’ in which you’ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself). In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.\n\nDuring the production of this course, we have been supported by Willem Kuyken, Director of the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre, and Stephen Batchelor, co-founder of Bodhi College.

Феномен призвания неизменно интересен всем, кто изучал и изучает проблемы мотивации, счастья, лидерства.\nВ основе курса лежит идея о первичности целого, хорошего, настоящего, о том, что плохое – это испорченное хорошее, и мы можем возвращаться к хорошему, то есть к целому, воспитывая в себе и в других чувствительность к призванию.\n\nПрактический смысл курса\n\nВ современном мире, ставшем в некоторых социальных направлениях очень тесным, жестким жить по призванию становится не только желательно, но и необходимо.\nПрагматический смысл изучения психологии можно свести к проблеме мотивации. Мотивация бывает разного качества. Если вы понимаете, как возникает и сохраняется мотивация, вы владеете ситуацией. Если мотивация для вас – неизвестность, случайность, сомнение и пр., то ситуация владеет вами. Данный курс способствует опыту осознания решающих точек вашего возможного «возвышения до человека» и «падения до человека»\n\nЦели курса\n\nДанный курс построен на диалектике призвания и принуждения. Нечувствительность к призванию ведет к принуждению, длящемуся до тех пор, пока чувствительность к призванию не будет восстановлена. Эта закономерность справедлива для самых разных уровней человеческого диалога с миром. Кем бы вы ни были: родителями, воспитателями, преподавателями, руководителями, тренерами, командирами, супругами, для вас будет полезным точно понимать: что такое призвание и принуждение, как они появляются и проявляются в вашей жизни.\nПроявления жизни по призванию - это обновление, жизнестойкость, инициатива, талант, эффективность. Но мы не всегда в достаточной степени чутки, открыты к призванию. Этот курс направлен на то, чтобы развить Вашу чувствительность к интонациям призвания и принуждения в жизни вообще и в конкретных делах в частности.","tutor":"Анастасия Стайпек and Олег Лукьянов","provider":"Coursera","language":"Russian","skills":["new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Personal Development","studentsInterested":"6","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/psykhologiya-prizvaniya","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera---8557"},{"title":"Creativity Toolkit II: Creative Collaboration","about":"Creativity requires us to collaborate with others.

Communication is an underlying process which creates and develops relationships, communities, societies. We communicative on a daily basis via a variety of means and channels. In our globalised and increasingly interconnected world, communication skills are essential in both the personal and professional spheres. It is our goal to leave you with a contextualisation and conceptualisation of communicative processes that will poise you to hone your own communicative skills — in other words, to put theory into practice.","tutor":"Olga Solovyeva and Maria Mordvinova","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["communication","communication theory"],"subject":"Communication Skills","studentsInterested":"18","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/communicationtheory-academia-practice","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-communication-theory-bridging-academia-and-practice-9986"},{"title":"Introduction to Negotiation: A Strategic Playbook for Becoming a Principled and Persuasive Negotiator","about":"This course will help you be a better negotiator. Unlike many negotiation courses, we develop a framework for analyzing and shaping negotiations. This framework will allow you to make principled arguments that persuade others. It will allow you to see beneath the surface of apparent conflicts to uncover the underlying interests. You will leave the course better able to predict, interpret, and shape the behavior of those you face in competitive situations.\n\nIn this course, you will have several opportunities to negotiate with other students using case studies based on common situations in business and in life. You can get feedback on your performance and compare what you did to how others approached the same scenario. The cases also provide a setting to discuss a wide-ranging set of topics including preparing for a negotiation, making ultimatums, avoiding regret, expanding the pie, and dealing with someone who has a very different perspective on the world. Advanced topics include negotiating when you have no power, negotiating over email, and the role of gender differences in negotiation. To close out the course, we will hear insights from three negotiation experts: Linda Babcock, Herb Cohen, and John McCall MacBain.

Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.\n\nSuccessful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters. They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world. After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.","tutor":"Professor William Kuskin","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["public speaking","communication","presentations","usa","north america"],"subject":"Communication Skills","studentsInterested":"489","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/presentation-skills","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-successful-presentation-6596"},{"title":"International Travel Preparation, Safety, & Wellness","about":"Whether you've traveled before or not, living and working overseas can be challenging.

No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.\n\nEste curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato.\n\nCada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:\n• Quais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?\n• Que diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?\n• Qual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?\n• Quais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?\n• Quais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?\n• Quais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?\n\nDurante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação. Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica.\n\nDependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez. Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que \"É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad\".\n\nApós assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador. Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso. Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.\n\nThis is a translated version.

Мы заглянем в разные сферы: работа, школа, семья, – и обнаружим в русском языке то, о чем не подозревают даже его носители.\nРусский речевой этикет рассматривается в сравнении с другими европейскими и азиатскими этикетами. Различия в них объясняются через коммуникативные стратегии и культурные шаблоны.\nНаряду с вежливостью мы обсудим и противоположные типы поведения – невежливость и анти-вежливость, то есть сознательное нарушение правил речевого поведения. К каким последствиям это может привести?\nВ заключение мы попытаемся ответить на главные вопросы. Зачем нужен речевой этикет? Что случится, если мы откажемся от вежливости и соблюдения речевого этикета?\nСреди задач курса есть и теоретические (см. выше), и практические. Слушатели узнают, как вести себя в определенных, иногда довольно нетривиальных ситуациях и как реагировать на речевое поведение собеседников. Но кроме ответа на вопрос «как», будут предложены ответы и на вопрос «почему». Почему люди себя так ведут и какие коммуникативные стратегии используют?\nНа лекциях мы постараемся достичь определенного баланса между теорией и практикой.

A number of tools, concepts, and methods are outlined in 3 MOOCS: Negotiation Fundamentals, Cross-cultural Negotiations, and Mediation & Conflict Resolution.\n\nTo be more specific, the following subjects must be mastered:\n- Get prepared for any negotiation;\n- Avoid traps;\n- Know how to prompt value-creating partnerships;\n- Structure an effective negotiation sequence;\n- Bargain in an efficient and respectful manner;\n- Overcome deadlocks;\n- Manager cultural differences in a negotiation;\n- Define what a mediation is and choose when to use it;\n- List different types of mediation;\n- Identify typical challenges and difficulties that most mediators face;\n- Choose the adequate strategies within a repertoire of options;\n- Identify the do’s and don’ts in mediation.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help you to put everything together, sharpen your skills and enhance your command of negotiation techniques and behaviors.\n\nWe’ve designed this MOOC in a highly interactive way. You will be engaged in a negotiation with peers. You will demonstrate your improved capacity to analyze, and therefore conduct, negotiations and mediation.\n\nThis capstone project will comprise three exercises. Here is an overview.\n\nIn the first exercise, you will analyse a real-life negotiation of your own choice. As an expert of negotiation dynamics, you will provide your reader with a detailed analysis of this real negotiation. Indeed as a professional, your task might not always be to conduct a negotiation - but to analyse what is going on in a given negotiation, or to help others (your boss, for instance) get ready for a high-stake negotiation. Guidelines will be provided in a separate document, to help you structure your assignment.\n\nFor the second exercise, you will negotiate directly with a peer. We’ve prepared a business case inspired from a true story.\n\nThe third exercise is linked to the previous one. Imagine that this negotiation is not successful, and that the relationship between the two negotiators becomes too tense. You will be asked to step into the shoes of a mediator - and to structure a mediation process.\n\nEach of these three exercises will be peer-evaluated.\n\nAs a result, it is really worth your engagement! Go ahead, engage fully into the exercises - you will have fun, and you will make further progress for real-life negotiation, mediation, and conflict management.","tutor":"Aurélien Colson","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["conflict resolution","negotiation","capstone"],"subject":"Communication Skills","studentsInterested":"48","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/negotiation-project","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-negotiation-mediation-and-conflict-resolution-capstone-project-9190"},{"title":"Mindshift: Transforma tu mente para superar obstáculos en el aprendizaje y descubrir tu potencial oculto.","about":"Mindshift es un curso diseñado para ayudarte a impulsar tu carrera profesional y tu vida personal en el mundo de cambios acelerados que vivimos hoy en día.

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.\n\nStudents taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course.

Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much “climbing the mountain” that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.\n\nIn this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping. Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the “cloud” using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless… Really!\n\n“But wait”, you will say, “there is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.” Great point! But what if… instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? “Ok, but that’s probably very complicated”, you will say.

While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.\nOnce you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example.

Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs. It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing.\n\nIn this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently \"know just enough Git to be dangerous\".\n\nThere are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)\n\nYou can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux.\n\nThis course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub).\n\nThis course tries to be as concise as possible.

The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy, as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry) and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit 3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition, and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks 11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.","tutor":"Leonard E.

But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it. Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains. This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.\n\nThe material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience. The book is called \"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press.\n\nThe course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\nwww.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition. She is the author of a recent book entitled \"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing. Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see. These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006. She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997). Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years. She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University. She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n\nAbout the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the Director of Academic Programs at Stanford University’s Center for Professional Development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science.

This course intends to present an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience the world—from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature.\n\nThis class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3.

How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.\n\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.\n\nEpigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros.

Scientists have pointed out that a rise in mean surface temperature of 2º Celsius above pre-industrial levels will put the Earth in dangerous, uncharted territory. Yet we currently are on a path toward an increase of 4º or more this century.\n\nFortunately, solutions exist to deeply decarbonize the global energy systems, and put the world on a 2°C pathway: improvements in energy efficiency in the building, transport and industry sectors; the generation of low-carbon electricity, through a mix of renewable energies (wind, solar), nuclear, and fossil fuels with Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS); and the shift to low-carbon energy carriers in energy end-use sectors, such as electric vehicles.\n\nDuring this course, you will learn about these solutions and how they can be applied in different national contexts, based on the results from the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP), a global initiative to show how countries can transition to a low carbon economy by 2050, and how the world can stay within the 2°C limit.\n\nPlease note that this course was created before the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21, in Paris.

Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.\n\nA lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.\n\nIn this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.\n\nThis course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment. An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.","tutor":"Ester van der Voet","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["economics","mining","metals","metal production","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Science","studentsInterested":"19","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy-metals","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-a-circular-economy-of-metals-towards-a-sustainable-societal-metabolism-9659"},{"title":"Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern","about":"What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ?\n\nMountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base.\n\nIn this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.\n\nThis particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able :\n\n- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions\n- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies\n- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions\n- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health\n- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.\n\nYour acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.\n\nThis MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.\n\nWe look forward to you joining us !","tutor":"Martin Beniston and Markus Stoffel","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["climate change","water"],"subject":"Climate Change","studentsInterested":"37","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-changes-mountains-water","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-climate-change-and-water-in-mountains-a-global-concern-10522"},{"title":"Dynamical Modeling Methods for Systems Biology","about":"An introduction to dynamical modeling techniques used in contemporary Systems Biology research.\n\nWe take a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling\ntechniques. The course is appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems.\n\nThis course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research. These techniques are based on biological mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally.

We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project.\n\nThe fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University. In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach?\n\nOne reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there. Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive. When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them.\n\nA second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.\n\nA third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background:\nThe class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry. However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly. For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.

These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.

Many disciplines have attempted to address the question, resulting in multiple and sometimes antithetical answers.\nNew understandings of the mind\nOn this course, Professor Mark Solms, Chair of Neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town, will adopt a multidisciplinary approach.\nHe will bring in perspectives from a range of disciplines, to explore four specific aspects of the mind- subjectivity, intentionality, consciousness and agency.

Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians.\n\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam.

Would such an understanding validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We’ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory.

What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it.\n\nThe second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths.\n\nThe final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.

Three main topics are covered: social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\n\nIn the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems. We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms. The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.\n\nYou can find a full syllabus and description of the course here: http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-II-Syllabus.html\n\nThere is also a predecessor course to this one, for those who want to learn or remind themselves of the basic concepts of game theory: https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1\n\nAn intro video can be found here: http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/Game-Theory-2-Intro.mp4","tutor":"Matthew Jackson, Kevin Leyton-Brown and Yoav Shoham","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Economics","studentsInterested":"2.4k","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-2","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-game-theory-ii-advanced-applications-1469"},{"title":"Understanding Research Methods","about":"This MOOC is about demystifying research and research methods.

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life.

This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.\nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.\nThis contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.\nThe course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts.

Economics is all around us.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the microeconomic theory of markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We will start with the concept of scarcity and how specialization according to comparative advantage helps us achieve more than we could alone. Next we model a marked using the tools of Supply and Demand and learn what well working markets accomplish and what their limit are. We end by exploring the impact of government intervention on perfect markets. Examples are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and evaluate market outcomes.","tutor":"Rebecca Stein","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["usa","north america"],"subject":"Economics","studentsInterested":"713","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/microeconomics-part1","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-microeconomics-the-power-of-markets-624"},{"title":"Introduction to Key Constitutional Concepts and Supreme Court Cases","about":"This course offers an introduction to the U.S. Constitution and landmark Supreme Court cases interpreting it.

Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand.\n\nAfter this course, you will be able to:\n• Describe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve.\n• Describe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve.\n• Explain equilibrium in a market.\n• Explain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium.\n• Explain elasticity of demand.\n• Describe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

В результате взаимодействия людей и фирм складываются рынки, на которых определяется цена – важнейший канал передачи информации.\n\nЧтобы информации было больше, существуют рынки, на которых продаются и покупаются товары и услуги. Потребитель никогда не купит нужный ему товар, если не узнает, где и как его можно купить. Производитель не станет его изготавливать, если не будет уверен, что найдется покупатель, который его приобретет. Каждый человек и каждая фирма обладает какими-то сведениями – прежде всего о себе самом, о своих вкусах, интересах, потребностях и возможностях. Однако информации у всех становится во много раз больше, когда субъекты начинают взаимодействовать – производят и потребляют, продают, покупают и меняются.

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English.\n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching.\n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law.

Маленькие дети, пытаясь добиться того, чтобы родители купили понравившуюся конфетку, часто шантажируют родителей своими слезами. Принимая решение заплакать, ребенок рискует — он не знает, как поведут себя папа с мамой. В чуть более взрослом возрасте абитуриенты, выбирающие вуз, принимают сложное решение о том, в какие университеты подать документы. Ошибка может стоить дорого: при неправильной стратегии можно оказаться в слабом университете или вообще остаться без заветного студенческого билета. Окончив вуз, юноши и девушки начинают искать работу. Перед интервью с работодателем они штудируют статьи в интернете о том, что можно и чего нельзя говорить на интервью, — они пытаются найти наилучшую стратегию своего поведения, исходя из ожиданий компании, в которую они устраиваются. Все эти ситуации объединяет то, что решения, которые принимают одни люди, оказывают влияние на других людей. Такие взаимодействия называются стратегическими. Именно их изучает теория игр.\n\nЧтобы проанализировать ту или иную реальную жизненную ситуацию стратегического взаимодействия и найти оптимальный вариант поведения в ней, необходимо сделать две вещи. Во-первых, необходимо формально записать ситуацию на языке теории игр, то есть создать модель (игру). Во-вторых, после того как модель (игра) составлена, ее необходимо решить. Этому мы будем учиться в течение курса. Мы разберем основные виды игр (одновременные и последовательные, с совершенной и несовершенной информацией, коалиционные и некоалиционные), приведем способы их решения и обсудим их на многочисленных примерах.\n\nКурс будет интересен желающим разобраться в том, как конкурируют друг с другом несколько компаний и можно ли гарантированно выиграть в шашки, есть ли смысл угрожать на переговорах и с кем стоит объединяться в коалиции в парламенте.\n\nFAQ\n\nВ: Требуется ли предварительная подготовка для прохождения курса?\nО: Курс является базовым, поэтому он не требует специальной подготовки. Для его успешного освоения достаточно уверенных знаний курса математики в объеме школьной программы. В одном-двух примерах могут пригодиться знания начал математического анализа (дифференцирование функций одной переменной, необходимое условие экстремума) и знания начал теории вероятностей (понятие математического ожидания случайной величины).\n\nВ: Что требуется для успешного окончания курса?\nО: Итоговая оценка за курс складывается из результатов 10 оцениваемых тестов.

Ya sea como madres, padres, cuidadores, profesores, profesionales de la salud, interesados en los medios de comunicación o en el tema de la sexualidad, con frecuencia nos planteamos preguntas como las siguientes: ¿Para qué educar sobre sexualidad, si existe abundante información al respecto? ¿La educación de la sexualidad debería brindarla la familia o la escuela? ¿A qué edad es adecuado iniciar la educación de la sexualidad? ¿La educación de la sexualidad aumenta la curiosidad sobre este tema? Para responder estos y otros interrogantes planteados por quienes participan en nuestras iniciativas de investigación y en los diferentes procesos educativos que llevamos a cabo, hemos diseñado este segundo curso con respecto a la educación de la sexualidad en diferentes ámbitos. De esta manera también queremos responder a las solicitudes de quienes ya tomaron nuestro primer Curso “Sexualidad… mucho más que sexo” de facilitar el acceso a otros cursos que profundicen en este tema.\n\nSi decides realizar este curso, esperamos que al final puedas reconocer claramente qué significa educar en el campo de la sexualidad así como identificar en qué contextos y en qué momentos ocurre esta labor.

It analyses the reasons for his actions and their results, as well as the causes of his popularity in Russia today. It offers an analysis of the phenomenon of Stalinism and of its significance for Russia and beyond.\n\nIn the late 1920s – early 1930s Stalin directed the massive and rapid industrialisation of the country and the forced collectivisation of its agriculture. The industrialisation was based on forced labour, and collectivisation on repression, but both helped to create the material base for the Soviet defence industry. In the late 1930s Stalin unleashed mass terror against the Soviet people, in which millions perished. In his view this helped to rid the country of any potential internal enemies on the eve of the coming war.\n\nThe USSR, together with its allies, won the Second World War, but at the cost of dozens of millions of lives. Stalin was instrumental in creating the post-war order. The system which he created in the 1930s shaped the USSR as it was during his lifetime and for decades after his death. It also influenced the lives of millions of people beyond the Soviet borders.\n\nThe course will enable those who take it to develop an informed understanding of the Stalin era and of the phenomenon of Stalinism.","tutor":"Irina Filatova","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["soviet union","stalin","stalinism","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Political Science","studentsInterested":"136","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/stalinism","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-stalin-and-stalinism-in-russian-history-8804"},{"title":"Налоговое право (Tax law)","about":"Курс предполагает изучение основ налогового права (общая часть), в том числе вопросов налогового законодательства; налоговой компетенции публичных субъектов; принципов налогообложения; понятия и системы налогов и сборов; элементного состава налога; правового статуса участников налоговых правоотношений; налогового обязательства и его исполнения; налогового контроля; производства о налоговых правонарушениях и налоговой ответственности.","tutor":"Шевелёва Наталья Александровна, Овсянников Сергей Вадимович, Килинкарова Елена Васильевна, Сосновский Сергей Анатольевич, Ногина Оксана Аркадьевна and Кустова Маргарита Валерьевна","provider":"Coursera","language":"Russian","skills":["tax law","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Law","studentsInterested":"7","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nalogovoye-pravo","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera---tax-law-9612"},{"title":"Economics of Transition and Emerging Markets","about":"The course analyzes challenges faced by transition and emerging-market economies, i.e., those middle- and low-income countries, which have conducted market-oriented economic reforms and become integrated into the global economy since 1990s.\n\nIt starts from a brief history of communist economic system based on central planning in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, its evolution and collapse at the end of 1980s/ early 1990s and subsequent transition to a market system in 1990s and 2000s.

Concepts are defined briefly and breezily and then applied to many examples drawn from business, the media and everyday life.\n\nWhat kinds of things will you learn? Why it’s usually a mistake to interview people for a job. Why it’s highly unlikely that, if your first meal in a new restaurant is excellent, you will find the next meal to be as good. Why economists regularly walk out of movies and leave restaurant food uneaten. Why getting your picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated usually means your next season is going to be a disappointment. Why you might not have a disease even though you’ve tested positive for it. Why you’re never going to know how coffee affects you unless you conduct an experiment in which you flip a coin to determine whether you will have coffee on a given day. Why it might be a mistake to use an office in a building you own as opposed to having your office in someone else’s building. Why you should never keep a stock that’s going down in hopes that it will go back up and prevent you from losing any of your initial investment.

Но до сих пор никто не знает, ни что такое сознание, ни как оно возникло, ни что оно делает. Курс представляет психологический взгляд на проблему сознания. Мы рассмотрим, как строятся теоретические гипотезы и как их нужно проверять в экспериментах. Слушателям будет предложен оригинальный подход к проблеме сознания, выводящий природу и законы работы сознания из логики процесса познания. В курсе рассматривается разнообразный круг поражающих воображение феноменов и экспериментальных результатов, которым дается единообразное объяснение. Указан путь, позволяющий приоткрыть завесу многих тайн, окружающих сознание, в том числе путь решения «вечных проблем», над которыми веками бьются мыслители (философы, психологи, физиологи, лингвисты и др.). Первые две лекции вводят слушателя в проблематику психологии сознания и знакомят с историей исследований. Основное содержание курса представлено в виде законов работы сознания, которые позволяют обобщить накопленный исследователями материал. Каждую неделю слушателям будут предложены лекции, демонстрационные материалы, а также задания по пройденному материалу.\n\nПосле прохождения курса вы будете обладать знаниями о психологических проблемах и возможных путях их решения. Получите знание о тех закономерностях, которым подчиняется сознание человека. Познакомитесь с методами исследования сознания, а также приобретёте огромный багаж знаний о экспериментальных феноменах, связанных с изучением сознания.","tutor":"Гершкович Валерия Александровна, Морошкина Надежда Владимировна and Аллахвердов Виктор Михайлович","provider":"Coursera","language":"Russian","skills":["psychology","consciousness","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Psychology","studentsInterested":"34","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/psikhologiya-soznaniya","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera---psychology-of-consciousness-9342"},{"title":"Введение в гендерную социологию (Introduction to the Sociology of Gender)","about":"Курс «Гендерная социология» ставит цель - изучение гендерной социологии как частной социологической теории.\n\nЗадачи курса:\nАкадемическая: обсуждение гендера как социологической категории, методологии, теории.\nПрактическая: проведение гендерного анализа состояния российского общества.\nПрикладная: проведение гендерной экспертизы политических и социальных процессов.\nИнновационная: изучение мужской и женской гендерных общностей, интегрированных в систему социальных отношений в политической и общественной сферах.\nКомпаративистская: проведение сравнительного анализа гендерных исследований в российской и зарубежной социологии.\n\nОсобенности: Изучаются отличительные черты генезиса, развития и трансформации гендерной модели социума на различных этапах его существования.\n\nОсобое внимание уделяется причинам возникновения гендерного неравенства и дискриминации по признаку пола.","tutor":"Валентина Григорьевна Ушакова","provider":"Coursera","language":"Russian","skills":["gender studies","sociology","new-moocs-2017"],"subject":"Sociology","studentsInterested":"12","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/vvedeniye-gendernuyu-sotsiologiyu","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-----introduction-to-the-sociology-of-gender-9347"},{"title":"Why Do People Migrate?
