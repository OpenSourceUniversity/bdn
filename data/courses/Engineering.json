In this course, we take a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like a microcontroller-based pacemaker, digital lock, and a traffic light controller. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this part 1 you will possess the knowledge to build your own traffic light controller from the ground up.\nThis is the fourth time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes over the previous offerings of the course. We did however break the large class into two smaller classes. There are eight labs in part 1 and six labs in part 2. Students can pick and choose a subset of labs to achieve certification.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. \nIn this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:\n3D geometry,\nprobabilistic state estimation,\nvisual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,\nlinear control.\nIn particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.\nThe course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks.

Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).\n\nFirst, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems.\n\nModel checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes\nthe functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.\nThe main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:\n\n- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .\n- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.\n- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties.","tutor":"Anne Remke","provider":"Coursera","language":"English","skills":["europe","belgium"],"subject":"Electrical Engineering","studentsInterested":"21","courseLink":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-model-checking","classCentralLink":"https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-quantitative-model-checking-7502"},{"title":"Cyber Security in Manufacturing","about":"The nature of digital manufacturing and design (DM\u0026D), and its heavy reliance on creating a digital thread of product and process data and information, makes it a prime target for hackers and counterfeiters.

Cela est particulièrement vrai des villes africaines, où la croissance s’opère principalement en périphérie, par la création de quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.\n\nL’existence et l’extension de ce type de quartiers interrogent sur la capacité de ces villes à intégrer les populations pauvres, en même temps qu’elles révèlent les limites des politiques urbaines à planifier et réguler le développement des grandes agglomérations. La question est devenue si préoccupante que la question de la restructuration des quartiers précaires dépasse aujourd’hui le cadre strict d’une intervention physique pour se poser comme une question de développement à part entière.\n\nQuelle lecture peut-on faire de l’existence et de la prolifération des quartiers précaires en Afrique?
